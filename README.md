# M for Form Factor Pico-ITX

<strong><span class="BalooThambi"><u>m4</u></span><em>ff</em>(Pico ITX)</strong> is a neural processing **Cluster-on-Module**.  This ultra low power SBC  provides **M** in small form factor for development of intelligent solutions. By customizing the **M** node mix to meet your performance and power efficiency profile, you'll be able to create the best platform that fulfils your needs.

##### Performance
An **Intel Atom x5-E8000 Series Processor** based ***(HP)<sup>2</sup>N*** augmented by **Intel Cyclone 10 GX with 85K LEs** based ***(P)<sup>2</sup>N*** provides the ability to handle the computing needs of different domains and products like Industrial Robotics, SmartHome, Drones & Edge Computing.

##### Power Efficiency with Adapter- and Battery-powered Operation
Pico ITX with operating voltage of 5V to 60V along with integrated standalone Li-Ion and Li-Polymer battery management is ideal for development of industrial robots, drones and edge devices. Incorporating an ultra-low power **ARM Cortex M7** based ***(LP)<sup>2</sup>N*** and a **Intel Atom x5-E8000 Series Processor** based ***(HP)<sup>2</sup>N***, ***M*** is capable of dynamic power management, powering up only the subsystems needed to fulfil assigned task.

##### Connectivity
